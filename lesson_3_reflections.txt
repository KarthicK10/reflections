When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I want to share and colloaborate with other developers or if I want to have a safer backup of my local repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	I may be in the middle of a change and may not be ready yet to take the updates from the remote 
	especially if the file to be updated is the same one that I am working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork is a clone within GitHub
	Clone is a copy of another repository
	Branch is a labelling of a commit which eventually start having its own changes irrespective of changes to the main branch.

	Use Fork when we want to work on others repsoitory on git hub.
	Use Clone to get a copy of another repository and work on it in our local.
	Use Branch when you want to try experimental features or when we want to create development versions of the code untouching the production version.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	It helps to know if we are ahead are behind the commits in remote. It helps to see the changes that are done to the remote after we did a last pull.
	It helps in merging the changes done to remote to our local.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Maybe, I will collaborate using just emails. I do not think its going to be easy in anyway and harder in all ways :)
	Harder to track, harder to merge.
