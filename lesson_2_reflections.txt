What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	The hidden folders containing metadata required for Git are created. This is needed for Git to track the history of changes to the repository and also to execute the git commands in the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area is in between working directory and the repository.
	The files in the working directory are untracked. The files in the repository are committed. The files in the staging area are tracked but not comitted.
	At the moment I haven't realised the value it offers.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	We can add only those files which we want to commit per logical change into the staging area and then commit them thereby ensuring one commit per logical change

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	Creating an experimental version of the code is a good situation to create a branch. Branches will let us make changes seperately while the main branch contiunes to change for actual implementations without being affected by our experimental changes. 

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	Diagrams help in realising what commits are reachable and what are not and what are the featueres or other commits done to the main branch since we branched out
